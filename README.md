# OpenLens

This is a personal binary build repository for [Lens](https://github.com/lensapp/lens.git) that stored Debian-based artifacts.

OpenLens is based on MIT license and is same as Lens IDE but without proprietary components.

Go to releases to download binary files for a Debian-based Linux OS.
